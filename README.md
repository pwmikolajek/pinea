## ✨ Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easily add images by dragging them into the app
- **Image Reordering**: Arrange your images in any order by dragging them
- **Client-side Processing**: All conversion happens in your browser - no data is sent to any server
- **Environmental Impact**: See how many trees you're saving by going digital
- **Instant Download**: Get your PDF immediately after conversion
